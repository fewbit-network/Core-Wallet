FewBit Coin – Balancing Self-Governance through SmartNodes, Staking, and Mining
FewBit is a self-governed blockchain network where all stakeholders—stakers, token holders, SmartNode operators, and community participants—can collaboratively influence the future of the project.

FewBit combines the power of Service Nodes and Staking Nodes. Service Nodes provide the infrastructure and computational resources needed for core blockchain functions, while Staking Nodes secure the network through our SmartNode system.

Fully decentralized and community-led, FewBit is free from centralized control. Its development is sustained by a self-funding mechanism that ensures transparency and long-term viability.

Enhancing GhostRider
Built on the foundation pioneered by Raptoreum, FewBit expands the GhostRider algorithm’s potential into emerging sectors such as GameFi and eCommerce.

From day one, we’ve upheld a strict no pre-mine policy, reinforcing our commitment to fair distribution and community-driven governance. To fund ongoing development, 5% of each block reward is allocated to the FewBit team, fueling continued innovation and ecosystem growth.
