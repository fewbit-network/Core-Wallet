FewBit Core
Decentralized. Fair. Future-Oriented.
FewBit is a self-governed, deflationary blockchain where SmartNode operators, stakers, miners, and community members shape the network’s future together.

🔗 What is FewBit?
FewBit is a hybrid blockchain project that combines:

🖥️ SmartNodes: Provide network services, governance, and stability.

🪙 Staking: Supports network security and community decision-making.

⚒️ Mining: Powered by the GhostRider algorithm (adapted from Raptoreum), designed for fair CPU/GPU Proof-of-Work.

FewBit is fully decentralized, community-led, with no pre-mine, and a transparent development fund.

💡 Key Features
🛡️ Self-Governance
SmartNode operators vote on network proposals and project funding through an on-chain governance system.

🔥 Post-Halving Burn Logic
Starting from block 300300, the network transitioned from a burn-based model to a sustainable Development Fund model.

Period	Burn / Founder Reward Logic
Pre-Halving	5% of block rewards burned (Founder reward burns)
Between Halving and Block 300300	Founder rewards active (no burn)
From Block 300300 onwards	5% of each block reward goes to the Development Fund Address

New Development Fund Address (from block 300300):

FBA69LP6syGpa3zGiiaQmkSUTY2XrtQbov
⚖️ Fair Distribution Model

Reward Split (From Block 300300 onwards)	Percentage
Miners	30%
SmartNodes	65%
Development Fund	5%

⚙️ Hybrid Infrastructure
Combines Proof-of-Work (PoW), SmartNodes, and Staking for a balanced and secure network.
